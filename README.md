# 📘 Bitcoin Real-Time Price Prediction & Analysis System

---

## 📌 Project Overview

The **Bitcoin Real-Time Price Prediction & Analysis System** is a web-based data analytics application developed using Python and Streamlit.
The project uses historical Bitcoin price data obtained from **Yahoo Finance** to perform trend-based analysis and real-time market evaluation.

The system allows users to enter the current Bitcoin price and instantly analyzes whether the market value is **High, Medium, or Low** based on historical trends.
A graphical dashboard visualizes past prices, current user input, and predicted future trends using machine learning techniques.

This project is designed primarily for **educational and analytical purposes** and demonstrates the practical implementation of **data science, machine learning, and web application development**.
